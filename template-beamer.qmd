## Goals

The main goals for this slide:

- This is just to show you how this \emph{template} works
- The blue in this template is based on the official Monash University color palette

# Tables and graphs

## Slide 2

A nice table

```{r}
mtcars |>
  select(mpg:wt) |>
  head() |>
  kable(booktabs = TRUE)
```

## Slide 3

And a graph

```{r}
#| fig-height: 3.8
mtcars |>
  ggplot(aes(x=wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point()
```
